# Blog_API_Project
Blog API Project using Node.js & EJS Templating

This was a challenge excercise provided by Angela Yu's Udemy Online Web Development Course. This is a BLOG style application, where the user can create, read, edit, or delete posts. 

For this project we are using EJS Templating & Nodejs. 

Run this project using npm.
1)  To run this project you will need to clone this repo using SSH or HTTP
2)  Open the folder in VS Code or applicable source-code editor with access to terminal
3)  When in the terminal, use npm install to install node dependencies - "npm install."
4)  You will now need to open up two terminals in the source code-editor.
5)  One Terminal will be required to run our API which is found on index.js, use - "nodemon index.js." Your localhost should be running on port 4000. http://localhost:4000/.
6)  Second Terminal will be required to run our Backend Server which will be found on server.js, use - "nodemon server.js." Your localhost should be running on port 3000. http://localhost:3000/.
7)  You can now go to the browser and enter in http://localhost:3000/, your Blog Application will now be available for you to read,create,edit or delete posts.

**PLEASE NOTE** - we are not using a database to store the data here, we are simply using an array found on index.js named posts. Your data will not be stored.
